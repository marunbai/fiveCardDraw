Five Card Draw Poker Game
============

A project I did while studying in University of Chicago. I plan on rewritting this project in ruby and make it a Texas holdem game.

To complie: make
To run: ./main

Input 1 to play game, 2 to quit.

In the game, u need to input the card index 1-5 to change card or don't input if don't want to change card.

After one game, Input 1 to play again, 2 to quit.

monte_carlo_advisor is implemented in hand.c & hand.h
Actually all the important part is in the hand.c & hand.h.
